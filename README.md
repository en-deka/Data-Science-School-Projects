For Cambia

I pulled data from CDC and FL heath charts to look for correlations between COVID vaccine hesitancy, infant death rates, varicella rates, and 7th grade immunizations compliance.  Only weak to moderate associations were found.  Unsurprisingly, varicella rates and infant death rates were positively correlated; as were infant death rates and 7th grade immunization compliance.  COVID vaccine hesitancy was moderately correlated to 7th grade immunization compliance, which is curious.
